# PhotoOverlayEditor: Minimalist Pro Redesign

## Completed Implementation

The PhotoOverlayEditor has been redesigned with an immersive, Instagram-style editing experience.

### Key Changes

1. **Full-Screen Hero Image** - Flex-based layout that maximizes photo preview (~70%+ of screen)
2. **Color-Coded Toolbar** - Visual groupings for intuitive editing:
   - Cyan: Content (Artist, Venue, Date)
   - Amber: Ratings (Score, Details, Notes)
   - Purple: Meta (Rank)
   - Muted: Utilities (Reset, Preview)
3. **Instagram Gradient CTA** - Vibrant pink→purple→indigo gradient with shadow glow
4. **Aspect Ratio Pill** - Compact toggle beside toolbar
5. **Simplified Secondary Actions** - "Friends" and "Save" in compact row
